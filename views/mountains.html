    After several minutes of hiking over the rocky terrain of the mountain path,
    you can see a fork in the road up ahead. A signpost indicates that the left
    path leads to Weightyword Bridge and the right path leads Letterlight Bridge.
    There are other signs on the post, but they are too small to read at this distance.
