    Upon closer inspection, you can see three small warning signs nailed to the signpost.
</p>
<div class="sign">
    <h4>Attention!</h4>
    <p>Words have weight. Make sure you know the exact weight of your full name</p>
</div>
<div class="sign">
    <h4>Warning!</h4>
    <p>Weightyword Bridge cannot handle a name with greater weight than its own</p>
</div>
<div class="sign">
    <h4>Caution!</h4>
    <p>The wind in the cannyon is very strong and may blow away travellers with light names</p>
</div>
<p>A post-it note at the bottom says "Space weighs nothing"</p>
